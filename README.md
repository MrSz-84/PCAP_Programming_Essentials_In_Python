# PCAP_Programming_Essentials_In_Python
My path through essentials of programming. I used PCAP in Python at Cisco Academy.

As for now I've managed to end both parts of the course.


## Plans for the future

1. Write some work related stuff that includes web scraping and and simple data manipulation.
2. Undertake few more courses including Python, uni testing, numpy, pandas, scraping.
3. What after points I listed above time will show...

So stay tuned ;)
